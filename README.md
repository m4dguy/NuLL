NuLL - Numerical algorithms Lighweight Library
====

Lightweight library for solving linear systems of equations, signal processing, matrix decomposition, etc.
Code provided in .h and .inl files.

TODO:

*matrix inversion incomplete

*more reliable algorithm for LU decomposition required

*bug in thomas algorithm
